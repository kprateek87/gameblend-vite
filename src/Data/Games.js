      "The sixth game in the Resident Evil series, Resident Evil 4, is hailed as a departure from the original Resident Evil titles.  Instead than using the same fixed camera angles as its predecessors, it was the first game to use a third-person perspective.  Its mechanics have been totally redesigned to include quick controls, fast-paced gunplay, and shootouts with large groups of adversaries in more open spaces.  Enemies can cooperate to corner and capture Leon thanks to the open areas and the recently implemented AI system. Since the enemies are now human, they may wield weapons, open doors, and climb ladders throughout the game. One of the most agonizing game development processes was Resident Evil 4, since the developers abandoned four different iterations before the final version was released.",

Unravel the dark secrets behind a deadly cult, fight for survival against relentless horrors, and experience one of the most intense action-horror adventures ever made.
